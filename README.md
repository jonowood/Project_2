# Project 2

### Data Cleanup and Analysis Requirements

Your team will be responsible for:

Citing the data sources.

Extracting the data from those sources.

Transforming the data (such as cleaning, joining, filtering, and aggregating it)

Loading the data into a database (either relational or nonrelational)

------

### Report Requirements

Once you’ve identified your datasets, you’ll perform the ETL process and create the documentation, which must include:

The datasets that you used and their sources.

The types of data wrangling that you performed (such as cleaning, joining, filtering, and aggregating).

The schemata that you used in the final production database.

-----

### Project Specialisation Requirement

For this Project we specialised in the field of population and census data

### Requirements

Project Proposal (20 points)
The proposal cites at least two sources of data. (10 points)

The proposal includes the type of final production database (relational or non-relational) that the data will be loaded into. (5 points)

The proposal gives a relevant and succinct description (2–3 sentences) of findings. (5 points)

Project Report (50 points)
The report describes the original data sources and how the data were formatted. (10 points)

The report explains what data cleaning or transformation was performed and why it was needed. (20 points)

The report describes the structure of the final database along with any improvements that could be made in the future. (20 points)

GitHub (30 Points)
GitHub repository is free of unnecessary files and folders and has an appropriate .gitignore in use. (20 points)

The README is descriptive, complete, and professional. (20 points)

Submission
To submit your project, click Submit, and then provide the URL of your GitHub repository for grading.

NOTE
Projects are requirements for graduation. While you are allowed to miss up to two Challenge assignments and still earn your certificate, projects cannot be missed.

Working with Your Group
When working on an online group project, it’s crucial to meet with your group and communicate regularly. Plan for significant collaboration time outside of class. The following tips can help you make the most of your time:

Decide how you’re going to communicate with your group members when you begin. Create a Slack channel, exchange phone numbers, and ensure that the group knows each group member’s available working hours.

Set up an agile project by using GitHub Projects Links to an external site.so that your group can track tasks.

Create internal milestones to ensure that your group is on track. Set due dates for these milestones so that you have a timeline for completing the project. Some of these milestones might include:

Project ideation

Data fetching/API integration

Data analysis

Testing

Creating documentation

Creating the presentation

Because this is a one-week project, make sure that you’ve completed at least half of the project by the middle of the week to stay on track.

Although you will divide the work among the group members, it’s essential to collaborate and communicate while working on different parts of the project. Be sure to check in with your teammates regularly and offer support.

Support and Resources
Your instructional team will provide support during classes and office hours. You will also have access to learning assistants and tutors to help you with topics as needed. Make sure to take advantage of these resources as you collaborate with your group on this project.

Project Guidelines
The following project guidelines focus on teamwork, your project proposal, data sources, and data cleanup and analysis.

Collaborating with Your Team
Remember that projects are a group effort. Working closely with your teammates will benefit the outcome of your project AND help you in your future careers. You’ll learn collaborative workflows that will enable you to approach and solve complex problems. In other words, working in groups allows you to work smart and dream big. Take advantage!

Project Proposal
Before you start writing any code, your group should outline the scope and purpose of your project. This will help provide direction and safeguard against scope creep.

The proposal is essentially a brief summary of your interests and intent. Be sure to include the following details:

The kind of data you’d like to work with and the field you’re interested in (finance, healthcare surveys, etc.)

The questions you’ll ask of the data

Possible source for the data

Use the following example for guidance:

The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in credit card fraud. We’ll examine relationships between transaction types and location, purchase prices and times of day, purchase trends over the course of a year, and other related relationships derived from the data.

Finding Data
Once your group has written a proposal, it’s time to start searching for data. We recommend the following curated sources of high-quality data:

IMPORTANT
You must have at least two data sources.

data.worldLinks to an external site.

KaggleLinks to an external site.

Data.gov.auLinks to an external site.

Awesome Public DatasetsLinks to an external site.

Public-APIsLinks to an external site.

Awesome APILinks to an external site.

IMPORTANT
Whenever you use a dataset or create a new dataset based on other sources (such as existing datasets or information scraped from websites), make sure to use the following guidelines:

Check for copyright protections, and make sure that the way you plan to use this dataset is within the bounds of fair use.

Document how you intend to use this dataset now and in the future. Find any licences or terms of use associated with the dataset, and review them to confirm that your intended use is in compliance.

Investigate how the dataset was collected. Identify any indicators that the data was obtained from a source that the compilers were not authorised to access.

You’ll likely have to adjust your project plan as you explore the available data. That’s okay! This is all part of the process. Just make sure that everyone in the group is aligned on the project’s goals as you make changes.

Make sure that your datasets are not too large for your personal computer. Big datasets are difficult to manage locally, so consider using data subsets or different datasets altogether.
